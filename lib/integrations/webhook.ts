/**
 * lib/integrations/webhook.ts
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The "every client has their own CRM/tools" answer: instead of writing
 * a native adapter for every CRM a client happens to use, this posts a
 * flat JSON payload to one URL the client (or their CRM's own inbound
 * webhook / a Zapier / Make / n8n catch step) provides. That URL is set
 * per-business as `integrations.webhookUrl` (fires for every lead and
 * booking) and/or per-channel as `integrations.crm.webhookUrl` /
 * `integrations.leadManagement.webhookUrl` (see business-schema.ts).
 *
 * When to write a real native adapter instead: once a specific CRM comes
 * up often enough (e.g. several clients all want native HubSpot contact
 * creation with field mapping) that the generic payload genuinely isn't
 * enough — until then, this covers the large majority of "push this lead
 * somewhere else" requests with zero new code per client.
 *
 * Never throws, never blocks the caller-facing response: every call site
 * fires this with `void` the same way sendOwnerAlert/sendCallerConfirmation
 * already are, so a slow or failing client webhook can never delay or
 * break the conversation.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
