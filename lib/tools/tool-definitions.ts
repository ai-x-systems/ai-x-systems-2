/**
 * OpenAI-compatible function/tool definitions. Both Vapi (voice) and Groq
 * (web chat) accept this exact shape, so it's defined once and reused by
 * lib/voice/providers/vapi/assistant-config.ts and
 * app/api/chat/[businessId]/route.ts.
 *
 * Deliberately NO "required" arrays on any of these. Groq's own function-
 * calling layer enforces "required" strictly server-side: if the model
 * calls a tool before it actually has every required field, Groq rejects
 * the entire completion with a 400 tool_use_failed error — before
 * lib/tools/execute-tool-call.ts's own field-by-field validation (which
 * handles this gracefully, e.g. "Before I can book that, I still need
 * your name") ever gets a chance to run. That 400 surfaced as a hard,
 * unrecoverable chat failure in production. Leaving every field optional
 * here means an incomplete/premature tool call is always allowed through
 * to our own code, which is the only place that should decide what to do
 * about missing data.
